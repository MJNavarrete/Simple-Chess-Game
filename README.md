PROPER READ ME:

The simpleGameBoard.java is the main GUI where we also have the rules implemented and is the final (but not finished) product.

Test main is where we have the terminal version of the chess demo set up and that was for submission 1.

Submission 2 is the SimpleGameBoard, but we have added it together with submission 3, so submission 2 and 3 are within the SimpleGameBoard.java file.

We wanted to get further but with our lack of experience with Java and time constraints, this was what we could cobble together.

Thank you.
